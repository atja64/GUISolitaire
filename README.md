# GUISolitaire
**A GUI version of solitaire made with JavaFX**

## Instructions

* Use the mouse to select cards.
* When a card or stack of cards is selected it will be highlighted in blue.
* With card(s) selected click on another card to try and move that card, if the move isn't valid you'll receive a warning otherwise the card will be moved.
* If a stack of cards is selected they will all be moved.
* Click the hand (top left) to reveal a new card.

## Rules

* The goal is to make four stacks of identically suited cards in the foundations (top right four spaces).
* You do this by moving cards around the board and from the waste (top left space) to the board.
* On the board you can only place a card on a card with value one higher than it and of a different colour.
* All but the top cards on the board are hidden at the start of the game. Move the card on top of a hidden card to reveal it.
* Only kings can be placed on empty spaces on the board and only aces on the foundations.
